# Functions avaliable in _configController_

## Introduction

In this controller, you will find functions related to the application's configuration management.
    
These functions allow you to retrieve, save, update, and delete configuration settings.
Additionally, the controller includes comprehensive validation to ensure that the data being saved or updated is valid, correctly structured, and of the appropriate data type.

Also, the format of the data is {key: key, value: value}, but to use the defined methods of dbController, we will use `key` as our `id`.
